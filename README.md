GitHub Challenge #4: "Greater Than Or Less Than"
This is a short program that takes in two integers from the user, then compares the two against each other. The program also repeats upon the user's request, and does a validation check on all user inputs.

This program works as intended. I appreciate the data validation. I didn't find any errors, aside from perhaps the fact that the numbers have to be within a certain range. However, you gave the decimal option, which I think is a good add-on. Otherwise I would suggest using 'long', so that when I smash all the numbers on the keyboard it still recognizes it lol
